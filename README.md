# Magento-2-Customer-Approval
Magento 2 Customer Approval by me is a solution which helps store owner to approve or reject new account registration from customers in specific cases. This is regarded as an effective control method of customer accounts in online stores using Magento 2 platform.

After Upload Run the following command in Magento 2 root folder:
 php bin/magento setup:upgrade
 php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
 php bin/magento cache:flush
